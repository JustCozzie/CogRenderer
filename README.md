## Adjust, Place, Recolour, and Screenshot.

A simple standalone utility for mathmatically generating cogs/gears. Made in Godot.

For anyone else wondering:
- A **"Cog"** refers to each individual tooth on the circle
- A **"Gear"** refers to two or more sets of cogs meshed together
- and the thing we think of when someone says either of the above is actually known as a **"Cogwheel"**.
